# 🚀 FaceLandmarkAI: CNN-Based Facial Landmark Detection 🎯

FaceLandmarkAI is a **deep learning project** that utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to accurately detect and align facial landmarks such as eyes, nose, and lips. This model improves upon traditional feature extraction methods like **PCA** and **Supervised Descent Method (SDM)** by leveraging CNNs for higher accuracy and efficiency.

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **facial landmark detection** for applications such as:  
✅ **Face recognition & authentication**  
✅ **Augmented Reality (AR) applications**  
✅ **Photo editing & virtual cosmetics**  
✅ **Facial animation & deepfake detection**  

It improves upon previous methods by using a **CNN model** trained to recognize complex facial features with greater precision.

## 📊 How It Works  

1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing & Normalization**  
   - All face images are normalized to ensure consistency.  
   - Pixels are scaled to the range [0, 1] for better model performance.  

2️⃣ **Feature Extraction using CNN**  
   - The model extracts key facial features like eyes, nose, lips.  
   - Unlike PCA-based methods, CNNs learn feature hierarchies automatically.  

3️⃣ **Training with Convolutional Neural Networks**  
   - The model is trained using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function.  
   - Early stopping is used to prevent overfitting.  

4️⃣ **Landmark Detection & Face Alignment**  
   - The model predicts the location of facial landmarks on new images.  
   - Uses structured mean error (SME) instead of traditional Euclidean distance for accuracy.  

5️⃣ **Real-Time Application**  
   - OpenCV is used to overlay detected landmarks on images.  
   - Potential real-world applications include **face filters, AR, and facial recognition**.
